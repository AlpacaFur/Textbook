        "content":"The Native Americans living in North America were much more spread out than their South American counterparts. They were extremely diverse and each group adapted to survive in the environments they lived in. Because of these differences, clashes were not uncommon even though they maintained a generally similar tribal structure. A chief or group of elders typically made decisions for the tribe and while the chief was typically male, women usually selected and advised him. This is one expression of  gender roles not being as fixed in Native American society as in Europe.",

        "detail":"The three crops corn, squash, and beans were called the \"three sisters\" because they were planted in such a way that each benefitied from the others' presence. The corn provided a platform for the beans to grow on, the beans enriched the soil, and the squash covered the ground, preventing the growth of weeds.",
